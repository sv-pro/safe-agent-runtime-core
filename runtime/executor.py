Executor
========

Subprocess transport facade. The execution layer.

The Executor holds NO handler functions. It holds only a path to the worker
script. Execution happens in a separate process; callable code is unreachable
from the main process.

ExecutionSpec is the ONLY thing sent across the boundary:
  - action_name (str)  — already validated by IRBuilder
  - params (dict)      — the parameters for the action

NOT sent:
  - handler functions
  - CompiledAction objects
  - policy objects
  - taint context
  - trust or capability metadata

By the time ExecutionSpec is created, the action has already passed all
ontological, capability, and taint checks in the main process.
