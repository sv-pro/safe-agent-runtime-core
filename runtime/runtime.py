Runtime — top-level assembler
==============================

Compiles the world manifest and wires together Channel, IRBuilder, and Executor.
This is the only module callers need to import for normal use.

Architecture (subprocess boundary edition):

                                            TaintedValue

Process boundary:
    - The main process (this file) holds NO callable handlers.
    - Executor is a transport facade: it creates an ExecutionSpec and sends it
      to worker.py via subprocess stdin/stdout.
    - worker.py runs in a separate process and owns the real handlers.
    - The main process cannot call handler functions directly.

Execution path:
    demo.py → IRBuilder → Runtime → ExecutionSpec → Executor → worker subprocess

Caller flow:
    from runtime import build_runtime
    from runtime.taint import TaintContext

    rt = build_runtime()
    channel = rt.channel("user")       # trust from compiled map
    source  = channel.source           # sealed — cannot be fabricated

    ctx1 = TaintContext.clean()
    ir1  = rt.builder.build("read_data", source, {"query": "x"}, ctx1)
    r1   = rt.sandbox.execute(ir1)     # TaintedValue — dispatches to worker

    ctx2 = TaintContext.from_outputs(r1)
    ir2  = rt.builder.build("send_email", source, {...}, ctx2)
    # ↑ raises ConstructionError if r1 was TAINTED and send_email is EXTERNAL
